В качестве базовых признаков я беру следующие комбинации:\n*1) умножение по 3  \n2) умножение по 2  \n3) делений 2 чисел  \n4) умножение двух и деление на третье\n5) возведение e в степень по признаку\n6) логарифм признака\n7) комбинация из 2х с возведениему exp в степень по одному признаку.\n\nВ дальнейшем можно создавать комбинации из комбинаций например в начале взять логарифм признака а потом перемножить получившиеся логорифмы признаков со всеми признаками в парах или тройках или же перемножив три признака взять логарифм их произведения и тд и
