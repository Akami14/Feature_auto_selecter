This is a project for automatic search a new feature forom existing feature in our data. The combination of some feature can hellp achive a better ML education.
The basic idia is that most formulas of our world, both physical and other spheres, consist of multiplication, division, or their combination.
As an example, below are the formulas:
F = ma, E = mgh, E = mw ^ 2 / 2, I = q / t, A = Fs, P = F / S IMT = m / l, p = mw, Cm = n / V, n = mM, n = N / Na.
In more complex processes such as biochemical reactions, calculation of reaction kinetics, either logarithmization or raising the exponent to one of the features or their group combination emerges.
In my work, I try to generate additional features. As basic features I take the following combinations:
1) multiplication 
2) division 
4) combination of multiplication and division 
5) raising e to the power of a feature
6) logarithm of a feature
7) combination with raising exp to the power of one feature.

In the future, you can create combinations of combinations, for example, first take the logarithm of a feature and then multiply the resulting logarithms of features with all features in pairs or triplets, 
or multiply three features and take the logarithm of their product, etc.
